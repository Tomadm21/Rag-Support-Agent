# Project Overview

## What is Support System Agent?

The Support System Agent is an AI-powered customer support platform designed to automate ticket handling, categorization, and response generation. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate, context-aware answers based on a knowledge base.

## Core Purpose

- **Automate First-Response**: Instantly acknowledge and attempt to resolve user queries.
- **Intelligent Routing**: Classify tickets by category, sentiment, and urgency for proper human escalation.
- **Knowledge-Driven**: Use Weaviate vector database to ground answers in company documentation.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.11+, FastAPI
- **AI/LLM**: LangChain, LangGraph, OpenAI (GPT-4 Turbo)
- **Database**: Weaviate (Vector DB)
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Deployment**: Docker Support (implied by docker-compose)

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Workflow**: Specialized agents for classification, retrieval, and generation orchestrating via LangGraph.
- **Real-time Streaming**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for typewriter-style response delivery.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Automatic detection of customer emotional state to prioritize critical issues.
- **RAG Integration**: Dynamic context retrieval from a scalable vector store.
