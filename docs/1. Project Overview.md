# Project Overview

## What is RAG Support Agent?

RAG Support Agent is an intelligent, multi-agent customer support system. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate, context-aware responses to support tickets by querying a specialized knowledge base.

## Core Purpose

The system aims to reduce support workload while maintaining high response quality. It automates the initial phases of ticket handling—classification, information retrieval, and draft generation—allowing human agents to focus on high-touch resolutions.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.9+, FastAPI, LangGraph, LangChain
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, CopilotKit
- **Vector Database**: Weaviate
- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo
- **Deployment**: Docker, Docker Compose

## Key Features

- **3-Agent Pipeline**: Specialized agents for Classification, Retrieval, and Generation.
- **Semantic Search**: Uses Weaviate to find relevant documentation based on intent, not just keywords.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Automatically detects customer mood to prioritize tickets.
- **Real-time Streaming**: Responses are streamed to the UI via Server-Sent Events (SSE).
- **Source Citations**: Every answer includes links to the documents used for generation.
